J.E.G. is involved in an international project led by NAU's [Nick McKay](https://directory.nau.edu/person/npm4)

## Objectives
The major scientific questions ACCEDE will address are: 1) Where are the tipping elements in Earthâ€™s climate and ecosystems? 2) What are the dynamics of ecosystems-climate feedbacks that drove rapid desertification in subtropical North Africa 6,000 years ago? And 3) where can climate models with realistic forcings simulate changes comparable to those observed?

## Products

The [Abrupt Change Toolkit](https://github.com/LinkedEarth/actR), written in R, is the essential output as of writing (October 2021)

## Support
Support for ACCEDE is provided by the [Belmont Forum](https://www.belmontforum.org/archives/projects/abrupt-change-in-climate-and-ecosystems-where-are-the-tipping-points) via the National Science Foundation
