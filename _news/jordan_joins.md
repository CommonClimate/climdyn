title: Welcoming Jordan Landers

We are thrilled to welcome Jordan Landers to the lab, as a first-year (but not quite first-timer) graduate student. Jordan was originally trained in the mathematical arts at Williams College, and had a short stint as graduate student at Columbia University in 2010-2013, before working as a data scientist in the software industry until last year. She has a unique combination of technical skills and scientific interests that makes her a perfect fit for this lab (but don't worry, we're quite accepting of other life stories!). Jordan is supported by USC and the [PaleoCube](https://medium.com/cyberpaleo/announcing-the-next-linkedearth-chapter-paleocube-790778b6ffb0) project, helping us create tools and tutorials that enable the paleoclimate community to do more with their hard-earned observations and model simulations. She's already proven herself a very creative teaching assistant as well! We wish her the best for her PhD, and have no doubt she we will bring the field forward in many ways.
