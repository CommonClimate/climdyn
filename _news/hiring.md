Our lab is looking for inquisitive, talented and generally quirky students to join the PhD program in the Fall of 2022, as we have several funded projects that need heads and hands.
The deadline to apply is Jan 1st; see [this page](https://dornsife.usc.edu/earth/graduate-admissions/) for details.  Note that, like many other peer institutions, our department no longer requires GRE scores, so please don't give in to that [wasteful pyramid scheme](https://eos.org/opinions/geogrexit-why-geosciences-programs-are-dropping-the-gre).

Before applying, however, do the following things:
- read [this blog post](https://strangeweather.wordpress.com/2018/01/04/friendly-advice-to-graduate-school-applicants/)
- ask yourself why you'd want to work in this lab, as opposed to any other on Planet earth
- [email me](mailto:julieneg@usc.edu) to see if we have common interests
