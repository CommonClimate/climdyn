Our lab studies how climate varies on timescales comparable to a human lifetime: the [bassline of climate](https://forecastpod.org/2018/12/20/episode-50-julien-emile-geay/). The lab is lead by Julien Emile-Geay, who blends data and models (both deterministic and probabilistic) to shed light on climate system behavior. He is particularly interested in constraining how much of climate variations arise from within, or are being triggered by external factors, natural or human. 

Beyond climate science, he also teaches the art of making reliable inferences from data, which is increasingly needed to cut through the cloud of misinformation, and provides economic opportunities for underrepresented groups. Professor Emile-Geay (it's a bit of a mouthful -- here's [how to pronounce it](https://www.name-coach.com/julien-emile-geay)) is passionate about educating people of all levels of scientific literacy to the reality of man-made global warming, using evidence-based knowledge to empower individuals to generate positive change.  Press [here](../assets/pdf/JEG_USC_CV23.pdf) for a detailed CV. For a recent presentation on paleoclimate data science, see [this video](https://youtu.be/2kxWQHwpo1c?t=97).
